# Bill's Hooks

Pre-commit hooks for my own projects.

## Usage

Add the following hook to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/Bilbottom/bills-hooks
  rev: v0.0.1
  hooks:
    - id: gitmoji-conventional-commit
```

## Available Hooks

### `gitmoji-conventional-commit` ([source](bills_hooks/gitmoji_conventional_commit/hook.py))

> [!WARNING]
>
> This is still in development and does not validate the commit message against the conventional commit framework yet.

This hook checks that your commit messages are (optionally) prefixed with a [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) and follow the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.
